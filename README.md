## 🚀 About This Project

Zombie Escape is a 3D top-down shooter built in Unity. This project was a deep dive into creating intelligent enemy AI and a responsive, satisfying player controller.

The primary challenge was implementing a robust **pathfinding system** for the zombies, allowing them to navigate complex levels to hunt the player. This project demonstrates my ability to create a complete game loop, from player controls and combat to enemy AI and game state management.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Intelligent Enemy AI:** Zombies use Unity's **NavMesh** system to dynamically find the shortest path to the player, navigating around obstacles.
* **Top-Down Player Controller:** A responsive twin-stick-style controller for 8-directional movement and 360-degree aiming (mouse-based).
* **Shooting & Combat:** A raycast-based shooting system for accurate hit detection.
* **Health & Damage System:** Both the player and zombies have health and can be "killed," triggering a game-over or death animation.
* **Game State Management:** A central game manager handles the game loop, tracking objectives (e.g., "Find the Key"), and managing Win/Loss conditions.
* **Dynamic UI:** A clean UI that updates in real-time to show player health, ammo, and current objectives.
